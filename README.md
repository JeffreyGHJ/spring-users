# spring-users
Spring Boot demo application built while learning the Spring framework. Users can securely create an account and login to see other registered users. Over the course of building this I learned about backend concepts like REST apis, C.R.U.D.  operations, Authentication, Persistence, Aspect Oriented Programming, and Templating using Thymeleaf.
